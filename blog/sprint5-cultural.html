            <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>

            <p>
                I learnt that it's a lot harder to write about myself and my thoughts than I thought it was. 
                I also learnt that my self confidence can fluctuate easilty depending on whether I have achieved the goals that I set out for myself.
                And lastly I learnt that my time management skills were horrible but i'm getting better at it now.

            <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

            <p>
                Knowing who you are and understanding your own emotions and motivators can really help imporove your learning and problem solving ability while programming.
                It can be a high stress environment and when working with others, emotions can get a bit out of control. So falling back on your values and having empathy can go 
                a long way in creating a conducive learning or working environment.


            </p>

            <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

            <p>
                I think just the fact that it is such an integral part of being a programmer is surprising and not something I thought of at all. 
            </p>

            <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

            <p>
                Writing. Putting thoughts to paper is definitely the most challenging part for me. In terms of blogs, the first one about Identity and values was the hardest.
            </p>

            <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

            <p>
                Like it's mentioned in the overview, "Tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team."
                In a job that is so centered on problem solving, emotions can get a bit out of control. It is very important to understand yours and other's emotions in a situations like that. You must be able to work efficiently and effectively 
                as a team.
            </p>

            <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>

            <p>
                No, not at all. The core learning that we are doing is very important. The technical stuff, if important, we can always learn and practice at our own time. 
                But even though core learning is important, we wouldn't make time for it if we weren't made to. People don't really take time out to take care of themselves and their well-being.
            </p>
