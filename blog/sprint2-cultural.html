            <h4>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>
From experience I can say that my long term goals keep evolving or changing as I go by. At the moment, my long term goal would be to create an app that encourages collaboration within the arts sector. 
</p>
<h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
</h4>
   <p> I would probably like to develop my organisational skills. Focusing more on time management and work efficiency. This is something that I find myself struggling with from time to time.
</p>
<h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations
</h4>
<p>    I am a creative and imaginative person and i’m good at problem solving. I love to meet and interact with new people and i’m able to work well with other people who can be very different from me. On the other hand, I tend to get distracted easily and often find myself day dreaming.
</p>
<h4>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
</h4>
  <p>  I am using toggl track and the timebox recommendations and that is really helping me stay focused and on task. I also take regular breaks to stretch my legs, drink some water etc. With regards to working productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives, I will - 
<uL><li>Be respectful at all times</li>
<li>Share my knowledge with others</li>
<li>Help others where I can</li>
<li>Be open and communicative </li>
</uL>
 </p>
<h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
</h4>
<p>If I need help, I will ask the facilitator or other learners on Slack. 
 
 </p>
<h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
</h4>
<p>I expect the facilitation team to give critical and helpful feedback on my work/tasks.
</p>
<h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
</h4>
<p>I do have some specific commitments and I have already planned for them and it won’t be a hindrance in my progress.
