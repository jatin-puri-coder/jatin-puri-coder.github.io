    <p>I'm a music producer/DJ and I'm currently learning how to code.
        This is my first attempt at a website and I really do hope it all just works the way it's supposed to :-P. 
        I'll start with 5 random facts about me but if you'd like to know more, please do head to the About Me section. 
        <ul>
           <li>I'm a massive Star Wars fan</li>
           <li>When I was 17, I trained to be a street magician</li>
           <li>I can speak 2 languages and I'm slowly learning a 3rd</li>
           <li>I studied in the oldest co-ed boarding school in the world</li>
           <li>I like to play basketball, tennis, squash and badminton</li>
