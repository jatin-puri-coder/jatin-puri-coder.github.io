    <p>I'm a music producer/DJ and I'm currently learning how to code.
        This is my first attempt at a website and I really do hope it all just works the way it's supposed to &#128540. Please do go check out my <a href="blog/sprint2-technical.html">Blog</a> to know more about how it's going. That picture of me on the right is an apt representation of how I was feeling while writing it!</p>
        
        <p>I'll start with 5 random facts about me but if you'd like to know more, please do head to the <a href="about.html">About Me</a> section.

           <li>When I was 17, I taught myself to be a street magician</li>
           <li>I can speak 2 languages and I'm slowly learning a 3rd</li>
