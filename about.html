            Writing about yourself is always tough so this will probably be a short one... 
          </p> 

          <p>
            I was born in India but grew up in Lagos, Nigeria and lived there until I was 13. When I was 12 years old I went to a boarding school in the Himalayas and studied there for 4 years. 
            I did a business degree after school but soon realized that a corporate life is not for me. Music is something that I have always been passionate about and so I went on to build a career in 
            music. I came to New Zealand in 2012 to study Sound Engineering and just fell in love with this country so didn't want to leave. Before covid-19 entered our lives I was teaching english at a language school 
            and absolutely loved it. After border closures, which resulted in no more international students, I was let go.  
          </p>
          <p>
            That got me to really think about what I want to do in my life. Web development has always been a keen interest for me and i've done a few "Wix" projects but wanted to actually learn how to code.
            Losing my job gave me the opportunity to reflect on this and so I chose Dev Academy.
            I am drawn to the creative aspect of coding and the challenge/excitement of problem-solving. And I am looking forward to seeing what this new chapter in my life will bring me.
